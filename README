Summary:
Color scheme with dark and light versions (GUI and 256 color terminal).

Description:
This color scheme was originally created by combining my favorite parts of
the following color schemes:

* oceandeep (vimscript #368)
* peaksea (vimscript #760)
* wombat (vimscript #1778)
* moria (vimscript #1464)
* zenburn (vimscript #415)

Version 7 has unified the 256 color terminal and GUI versions (the GUI
version only uses colors available on the 256 color terminal). The overall
colors were also toned down a little bit (light version is now a light gray
instead of white and the dark version is slightly lighter) to make it easier
on the eyes.

Version 6+ has been revamped a bit from the original color scheme. If you
prefer the old style, or the 'blue' version, use the 5Final release. Version
6+ only has a light and dark version. The new version tries to unify some of
the colors and also adds more contrast between text and interface.

The color scheme is dark, by default. You can change this by setting the
g:lucius_style variable to "light", "dark", or "dark_dim". Once the color
scheme is loaded, you can use the commands "LuciusLight", "LuciusDark", or
"LuciusDarkDim" to change schemes quickly.

colorsupport.vim (vimscript #2682) is used to help with mapping the GUI
settings to the 256 terminal colors.

This color scheme also has custom colors defined for the following plugins:

* vimwiki (vimscript #2226)
* tagbar (vimscript #3465)
